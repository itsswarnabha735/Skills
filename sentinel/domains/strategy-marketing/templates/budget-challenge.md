# Budget Challenge - Zero-Based Reallocation

## Goal
Compare habit-based allocation to performance-based allocation.
The gap = your "tradition budget."

## Step 1: Current state

| # | Channel | Annual budget | % | PROVEN ROI | Proof source |
|---|---------|--------------|---|------------|-------------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |
| **Total** | | **$______** | **100%** | | |

**Warning**: If "proven ROI" is empty or says "estimated" - red flag. You're
spending without proof of return.
---


## Step 2: Zero-Based

Start from zero. Allocate to highest proven ROI first, then next, until budget is spent.

| Priority | Channel | Zero-based budget | % | Justification |
|----------|---------|-------------------|---|---------------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| **Total** | | **$______** | **100%** | |

---

## Step 3: Compare

| Channel | Current | Zero-based | Gap | Over/Under-invested |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----|---------------------|
| | | | | |

**Tradition budget** = sum of over-investments = **$______**

## Step 4: Noise Audit (team > 1)

Each member does the exercise INDEPENDENTLY.

| Channel | Person A | Person B | Person C | CV (%) |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| | | | | |

```bash
timeout 10 python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/decision-hygiene/scripts/noise.py" --json '{"algorithm":"cv","data":[A, B, C]}'
```

**Average CV**: ___% -> LOW (<15%) / MODERATE (15-30%) / HIGH (>30%)

## Decision

**Reallocations decided:**
1.
2.
