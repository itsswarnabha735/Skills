biases:

    name: Deal Completion Bias
    alias: ["closing imperative", "deal fever", "process momentum", "sunk cost deal"]
    description: >
      Teams working a deal for months develop a strong psychological and
      professional investment in closing it. The due diligence process itself
      creates commitment escalation - every consultant hour, every management
      presentation, every board update makes the deal harder to kill.
      The people most capable of identifying fatal flaws are the people most
      motivated to overlook them. This is the most dangerous bias in M&A
      because it operates silently and is reinforced by everyone in the room.
    detection_questions:
      - "If this deal appeared on your desk today with no prior work done,
        would you still pursue it at the current price and terms? If you're
        hesitating - the sunk cost is distorting your judgment."
      - "Who in the process has explicitly argued against closing?
        If no one has, why not? Is it because the deal is genuinely solid,
        or because dissent has been implicitly discouraged?"
      - "What would have to be true for you to walk away from this deal
        at this stage? Write that down. Now check if those conditions exist."
    typical_context: "We've spent 6 months on this - we can't stop now"

    name: Synergy Theater
    alias: ["synergy inflation", "optimistic synergy", "pro forma synergies", "synergy gap"]
    description: >
      Projected synergies in M&A are systematically and significantly
      overestimated. The bias operates in two directions simultaneously:
      cost synergies are underestimated in execution difficulty, and revenue
      synergies are estimated with near-zero historical base rate support.
      McKinsey research: 70% of deals fail to achieve projected synergies
      within the announced timeline. The team that projects synergies is
      the team most emotionally invested in the deal - creating a direct
      conflict of interest in the estimation process.
    detection_questions:
      - "What percentage of synergies projected in deals of similar type
        in your sector were actually achieved within the announced timeline?
        If you don't have this number - your projection has no base rate."
      - "Who built the synergy model? Were they also involved in sourcing
        the deal? If yes - they have a conflict of interest that affects
        every number in the model."
      - "Line by line: for each synergy, what is the specific execution
        action required, who owns it, and what's the earliest realistic date
        it appears in P&L? If any synergy can't be described at this level
        of specificity - treat it as zero."
    typical_context: "The synergy model shows $50M in Year 2 cost savings"

  - id: MA3
    name: Integration Optimism
    alias: ["integration underestimation", "soft factors neglect", "cultural fit assumption"]
    description: >
      Deal teams consistently underestimate integration complexity because
      integration is invisible during due diligence. The data room contains
      financials, contracts, and IP - not cultural friction, IT architecture
      complexity, or middle management resistance. These invisible factors
      are the primary drivers of integration failure. Teams that have never
      run an integration are systematically overconfident about running one.
      The 2-year integration estimate is almost always wrong by 50-100%.
    detection_questions:
      - "Who on the deal team has directly managed a post-acquisition
        integration of comparable scale? If the answer is 'no one' -
        your timeline and cost estimates need an external reference class."
      - "What are the 3 most likely points of cultural friction between
        the two organizations? Have you spoken to anyone below C-suite
        in the target to understand actual working culture?"
      - "What happens to the target's key people in months 3-6 post-close?
        What's the retention plan? What's the cost of losing the top 10%
        of performers in the target?"
    typical_context: "Integration will be complete in 18 months" (with no integration PMO named)

  - id: MA4
    name: Artificial Timeline Pressure
    alias: ["deal urgency", "competitive bidding pressure", "FOMO deal", "fake deadline"]
    description: >
      M&A processes are often structured to create time pressure that
      benefits the seller: compressed due diligence windows, artificial
      auction deadlines, and "other bidders" signals. This pressure
      deliberately prevents the independent, unhurried evaluation that
      good decisions require. Buyers who accept artificial timelines as
      real constraints are systematically disadvantaged.
      The most dangerous version: the timeline is internally generated
      ("we must close before Q4") rather than externally imposed.
    detection_questions:
      - "Who set this timeline and why? Is the deadline externally imposed
        by the seller, or internally generated by our own process?
        What happens concretely if we take 4 more weeks?"
      - "What due diligence items were deferred or abbreviated because of
        time pressure? Are any of these items deal-material?"
      - "If this deal takes 6 months longer than planned, what is the
        actual cost? Often the answer is 'not much' - and the real
        pressure is social, not economic."
    typical_context: "We need to sign by end of month or we lose the deal"

  - id: MA5
    name: Reference Class Neglect
    alias: ["inside view M&A", "this deal is different", "uniqueness bias", "base rate blindness"]
    description: >
      Deal teams analyze each acquisition from the inside view - this target,
      this market, this management team, this set of synergies. They systematically
      fail to consult the outside view: what happens to deals like this?
      The outside view in M&A is brutal. 70% of deals fail to create value
      (McKinsey). Premium paid above market averages 30-40% - almost always
      destroying acquirer shareholder value in the long run.
      These are not rare failure cases. They are the modal outcome.
    detection_questions:
      - "What is the historical track record of similar deals (same deal type,
        same sector, same size range) in terms of value creation for the acquirer?
        Has anyone pulled this data?"
      - "What premium are you paying vs. the sector average? What is the historical
        correlation between deal premium and acquirer value creation in this sector?"
      - "If you had to bet on this deal creating value based solely on the
        statistical base rate - not your specific thesis - would you still do it?"
    typical_context: "This situation is unique because [specific thesis]" (without comparing to base rate)

  - id: MA6
    name: Advisor Alignment Distortion
    alias: ["banker incentive bias", "fee-driven advice", "sell-side perspective", "advisor pressure"]
    description: >
      Investment bankers, lawyers, and consultants in an M&A process are paid
      when the deal closes - not when the acquirer creates value. This creates
      a structural conflict of interest that systematically biases advice toward
      deal completion. Aschbacher & Kroon (2025): advisor-client relationships
      generate additional biases through time pressure, standardization of
      analysis, and emotional dynamics in the process.
      The advisor who raises a fatal flaw late in the process loses the deal
      and their fee - creating strong incentives to frame issues as "manageable."
    detection_questions:
      - "What is the total fee structure for each advisor, and how much of it
        is contingent on deal closing? The proportion of success fee vs.
        retainer tells you something about their incentives."
      - "Have any advisors explicitly recommended walking away from a deal
        before? If you can't name an instance - they may be structurally
        unable to give you that advice."
      - "On the key risk areas: are you getting the advisor's real view
        or their managed view? What would they say differently if they
        were paid a flat fee regardless of outcome?"
    typical_context: "Our advisors have reviewed everything and are comfortable"

  - id: MA7
    name: Halo Effect (Deal)
    alias: ["product halo", "team halo", "market halo", "one-dimension contamination"]
    description: >
      A single outstanding dimension of the target contaminates the evaluation
      of all other dimensions. A great product makes the team seem stronger.
      A strong market makes the execution risk seem smaller. A charismatic
      founder makes the integration seem simpler. In M&A, the halo effect
      operates across the entire deal narrative - the thesis that justified
      pursuing the deal becomes the lens through which every subsequent
      piece of information is interpreted.
    detection_questions:
      - "What is the one thing that makes this deal exciting? Now score
        ONLY the other dimensions - without mentioning that one thing.
        Do the scores change?"
      - "If the target's strongest dimension (product/team/market) were
        average instead of exceptional, would you still be pursuing the deal?
        At the same valuation?"
      - "List the three biggest problems with this target. Were these
        problems discovered before or after the deal thesis was formed?
        If after - they may have been systematically underweighted."
    typical_context: "Their product is exceptional, the team must be great too"

  - id: MA8
    name: Winner's Curse Blindspot
    alias: ["auction winner's curse", "competitive bidding bias", "overbidding pressure"]
    description: >
      In any competitive M&A process, the winner is systematically the party
      that made the most optimistic assessment of the target. This is not
      a sign of superior insight - it is a statistical artifact of the
      auction process. Winning a competitive bid is Bayesian evidence that
      you overestimated the target's value relative to every other informed
      party who also reviewed the data room and chose not to bid at your price.
    detection_questions:
      - "How many other parties were in this process? What does their
        decision not to bid at your price tell you? Have you updated
        your valuation based on this information?"
      - "If you win this auction, what does winning tell you about whether
        you paid the right price?"
      - "What information did you have that the other bidders didn't?
        If the answer is 'nothing significant' - your superior bid
        is Bayesian evidence of overestimation."
    typical_context: "We won the process against 4 other bidders" (presented as positive signal)
