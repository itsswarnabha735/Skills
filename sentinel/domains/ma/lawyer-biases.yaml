    name: Risk Identification Without Probability
    alias: ["risk inflation", "legal exhaustion", "zero-probability risk listing", "risk menu"]
    description: >
      Lawyers are trained to IDENTIFY risks, not to assess their probability
      or expected impact. A risk with 0.1% probability and a risk with 40%
      probability receive similar treatment in a legal memo - they both get
      a paragraph. This systematic failure to weight risks produces memos that
      are formally complete and practically useless for decision-making.
      The client cannot distinguish deal-breaking risks from theoretical ones.
      The result: either everything is escalated (decision paralysis) or
      everything is normalized (real risks disappear in the noise).
      Guthrie et al. (2001): judges - professionals trained in probabilistic
      reasoning - still exhibit strong anchoring and framing effects.
      Lawyers are not immune.
    detection_questions:
      - "For each legal risk identified: what is your honest probability estimate
        that it materializes? If you haven't assigned a probability - your memo
        is a risk list, not a risk assessment."
      - "Of the risks in your DD report, how many are above 10% probability?
        5%? 1%? If you don't have these numbers - how is the client supposed
        to prioritize?"
      - "What is the single risk most likely to actually affect this deal?
        Is it the one with the most pages in your report?"
    typical_context: "The due diligence report lists 47 legal risks of varying severity"

    name: Precedent Anchoring
    alias: ["prior deal anchoring", "template lock-in", "boilerplate inertia", "we always do it this way"]
    description: >
      Lawyers systematically anchor to prior transaction documents. Clauses
      designed for a different deal, a different jurisdiction, or a different
      risk allocation are copy-pasted with minor modifications into new contexts.
      The prior document becomes the anchor - negotiations focus on deltas from
      the anchor rather than on what the clause should optimally achieve.
      This produces deals where the documentation reflects precedent practice
      rather than the actual risk allocation that makes sense for THIS transaction.
      The most dangerous form: using a seller-friendly SPA template as starting
      point in a buyer-represents situation, or vice versa, because "we have one."
    detection_questions:
      - "Which prior deal was used as the template for this document? How similar
        is that deal to this one in terms of deal type, sector, jurisdiction,
        and risk profile?"
      - "For each non-standard clause negotiated: are you negotiating toward
        what's right for this deal, or away from what the other side wants
        relative to the anchor document?"
      - "If you built this document from first principles for this specific
        deal - what would be different? Is anything in the current draft
        there purely because of precedent?"
    typical_context: "We're using the SPA from the [prior deal] as the base"

    name: Professional Liability Anchoring
    alias: ["CYA drafting", "liability-driven advice", "defensive opinion", "lawyer protection bias"]
    description: >
      Lawyers write opinions, memos, and contracts with significant weight on
      their own professional exposure. The advice that is safest for the lawyer
      (conservative, comprehensive, heavily qualified) is not necessarily the
      advice that is most useful for the client. This creates systematic bias
      toward over-qualification ("subject to the foregoing"), excessive carve-outs,
      and conservative positions on risk that protect the adviser more than
      the client's interests. Kiser et al. (2008): lawyers systematically
      recommended settlement at amounts that proved disadvantageous - motivated
      reasoning about their own exposure influenced their advice.
    detection_questions:
      - "Is this opinion or recommendation the advice you would give if you
        had zero professional liability exposure? If it's different - what's
        the actual advice?"
      - "How many of the qualifications in this memo are there to protect
        the client vs. to protect the firm? Would the client benefit from
        a less qualified, more direct version?"
      - "Is your advice on this risk point driven by what you believe is
        likely, or by what you need to have documented if it goes wrong?"
    typical_context: "Our advice is qualified by the standard limitations in our engagement letter"

    name: Adversarial Escalation
    alias: ["negotiation as combat", "winning over closing", "principle over pragmatism", "deal-killing perfectionism"]
    description: >
      M&A lawyers are trained as adversaries. In deal negotiations, this
      adversarial framing can replace the value-creation framing that should
      govern M&A. Lawyers fight for positions on principle long after the
      commercial value of those positions is near zero. The "win" is defined
      as extracting a better clause, not as getting the best deal closed.
      Deals are killed or delayed over points that represent a fraction of
      the deal value, because the lawyer's professional identity is invested
      in not losing the negotiation. Silver (2002): the lawyer's role often
      creates a principal-agent problem - the lawyer's interests (clean
      outcome, no surprises, professional reputation) diverge from the
      client's interests (deal done at the right value).
    detection_questions:
      - "For each currently open negotiation point: what is the commercial
        value to the client of winning this point? Compare it to the cost
        of delay and relationship damage. Is this point worth the fight?"
      - "Is there any point in the current negotiation where the lawyer's
        professional interest in 'winning' diverges from the client's
        commercial interest in 'closing'?"
      - "Which open points are actually important to the client vs. important
        to you as their lawyer? Have you had that conversation explicitly?"
    typical_context: "We're not moving on this clause - it sets a bad precedent"

  - id: LA5
    name: Disclosure Letter Normalization
    alias: ["disclosure fatigue", "materiality creep", "disclosure letter underweighting", "buried disclosure"]
    description: >
      In SPA transactions, the seller's disclosure letter contains exceptions
      to representations and warranties. These disclosures are often detailed,
      lengthy, and written to minimize their apparent significance. Lawyers
      reviewing disclosure letters suffer two related biases: (1) volume
      normalization - after reviewing 200 disclosures, each individual one
      seems less significant, (2) deal narrative anchoring - disclosures
      that contradict the deal thesis are unconsciously underweighted.
      A disclosure letter can materially change the deal's risk profile
      while generating no change in price or structure.
    detection_questions:
      - "Is there any disclosure in this letter that, if disclosed BEFORE
        the deal was negotiated, would have changed the price or structure?
        If yes - why hasn't it changed the price or structure now?"
      - "Which 3 disclosures in this letter are the most materially adverse?
        Have you briefed the client on these specifically, outside the
        context of the full letter?"
      - "Has anyone on the deal team read the disclosure letter fresh,
        without the deal thesis in mind, asking 'what would I think of
        this business if this were my first look at it?'"
    typical_context: "The disclosure letter has been reviewed - there are no show-stoppers"

  - id: LA6
    name: Completeness Over Clarity
    alias: ["legal perfectionism", "comprehensive at the cost of usable", "document complexity bias"]
    description: >
      Lawyers optimize for completeness - covering every conceivable contingency -
      over clarity and usability. This produces contracts and memos that are
      formally exhaustive but practically unnavigable. The completeness bias
      creates several downstream problems: (1) parties don't understand what
      they've agreed to, creating disputes later; (2) transaction complexity
      delays closing and increases cost; (3) the most important provisions are
      buried in the body of a 300-page document that no one re-reads.
      The paradox: a more complete contract often creates more litigation
      risk because the more you specify, the more you create arguable gaps
      in what you haven't specified.
    detection_questions:
      - "Can the CEO of the acquiring company explain in plain language what
        the top 5 obligations they're taking on under this SPA?
        If not - the document has failed its primary purpose."
      - "Which provisions of this contract are genuinely novel to this deal
        vs. standard? Are the novel provisions clearly flagged for client attention,
        or buried in the general body?"
      - "What is the one scenario most likely to create a dispute under this
        contract? Is that scenario addressed clearly and unambiguously?"
    typical_context: "The SPA covers all conceivable scenarios"

  - id: LA7
    name: Reps and Warranties Ritualism
    alias: ["R&W theater", "negotiation for its own sake", "warranty inflation", "coverage maximalism"]
    description: >
      Reps and warranties negotiations often become ritualized - both sides
      know the approximate final position but spend significant time and
      cost getting there. Buyers push for comprehensive reps; sellers push
      back with qualifiers. The negotiation follows predictable patterns
      regardless of the actual risk profile of the specific transaction.
      This ritualism is expensive (legal fees, time), and produces outcomes
      that don't reflect careful risk allocation - they reflect negotiating
      leverage and precedent. The rise of R&W insurance has not eliminated
      this pattern; it has added a third party to the ritual.
      The result: the reps and warranties in the final document may not
      accurately reflect the actual risks identified in due diligence.
    detection_questions:
      - "For each rep being heavily negotiated: what is the probability
        it is breached? What is the damages exposure? Is the negotiation
        cost proportionate to the risk exposure?"
      - "Is R&W insurance available for this deal? If yes, at what cost?
        Compare the insurance cost to the legal cost of negotiating the
        disputed reps. Often insurance is cheaper."
      - "Which reps are being negotiated purely out of precedent ('we always
        push for this') vs. because of specific DD findings that make this
        rep material for this deal?"
    typical_context: "We're pushing back on the knowledge qualifier on all business reps"
