    name: "MAP M&A - Target Evaluation (6 dimensions)"
    description: >
      6 independent dimensions for evaluating any acquisition target.
      Scored INDEPENDENTLY by each evaluator before any discussion.
      Designed to prevent the Halo Effect (MA7) and deal completion bias (MA1)
      from contaminating independent dimensions.
      Each dimension has a confidence score (0-100%) in addition to the
      performance score (0-10), to surface hidden uncertainty.
    dimensions:
      - name: "Strategic fit"
        scale: "0-3: tangential or contradicts strategy | 4-6: supports strategy | 7-10: directly on the critical path of the #1 strategic priority"
        question: "Which specific strategic objective does this acquisition advance? Is it the top priority, or a secondary one? What would you have done instead without this acquisition?"
        confidence_probe: "How confident are you in this score? What would change it?"

      - name: "Market and competitive position"
        scale: "0-3: declining or undifferentiated market | 4-6: stable market, moderate position | 7-10: growing market, defensible moat, durable competitive advantage"
        question: "What is the target's competitive moat in specific, mechanical terms - not 'great team' or 'brand'? What prevents a competitor from replicating their position in 3 years?"
        confidence_probe: "What market data did you use? How reliable is it? What are you assuming?"

      - name: "Financial quality"
        scale: "0-3: declining revenue, unprofitable, or opaque financials | 4-6: stable, visible, with some concerns | 7-10: growing, profitable, clean financials, recurring revenue"
        question: "What percentage of revenue is recurring vs. transactional? What is the customer churn rate? Are the financials GAAP-audited or management accounts?"
        confidence_probe: "Which financial items have you not fully diligenced? What could be hidden?"

      - name: "Synergy credibility"
        scale: "0-3: vague or revenue synergies only | 4-6: cost synergies with some specificity | 7-10: synergies line-by-line with owner, timeline, and P&L entry point identified"
        question: "For each synergy line: who is specifically responsible for execution? When does it appear in P&L? What does executing it require? If any synergy can't be described at this level - score it zero."
        confidence_probe: "What % of synergies are cost vs. revenue? Revenue synergies should have a higher discount rate."

      - name: "Integration feasibility"
        scale: "0-3: complex integration, cultural mismatch, no integration plan | 4-6: manageable with significant effort | 7-10: simple integration, cultural alignment, detailed plan with named owners"
        question: "Who runs the integration? Do they have direct experience with integrations of this complexity? What are the top 3 cultural friction points between the two organizations?"
        confidence_probe: "Have you spoken to below-C-suite employees in the target? What did you find?"

      - name: "Valuation relative to value"
        scale: "0-3: significant premium with weak justification | 4-6: fair value with moderate upside | 7-10: clear upside case, conservative base case, stress-tested downside"
        question: "What are the comparable transaction multiples in this sector? What premium are you paying? In a downside scenario where synergies deliver at 50% - does the deal still create value?"
        confidence_probe: "What is your downside case, specifically? At what price would you walk away?"

    scoring:
      note: >
        Score each dimension independently. Do NOT discuss scores with other
        committee members before all scores are submitted. This is the MAP
        protocol's core requirement - independent evaluation prevents the
        Halo Effect from spreading across dimensions.
      total_threshold:
        strong_proceed: 42  # Average 7/10 across 6 dimensions
        conditional: 30     # Average 5/10 - requires specific risk mitigations
        reconsider: 24      # Average 4/10 - fundamental concerns
        do_not_proceed: 18  # Average 3/10 or lower

  - id: NOISE_AUDIT_COMMITTEE
    name: "Committee Noise Audit"
    description: >
      The flagship commercial application of Sentinel in M&A.
      Measures judgment variance between committee members on the same
      target or decision. The result - often a CV of 35-60% - is
      the most powerful demonstration that the committee is not
      evaluating, it is negotiating.
      Based on Kahneman (Noise, 2021): "The first step is a noise audit."
    protocol:
      phase_1:
        name: "Independent scoring"
        instructions: >
          Each committee member scores all 6 MAP_MA dimensions independently,
          in writing, WITHOUT seeing or hearing other members' scores.
          The senior-most member scores LAST (prevents seniority anchoring).
          Time allocation: 20-30 minutes per target.
        critical_rule: "No verbal discussion until ALL scores are submitted. No exceptions."

      phase_2:
        name: "Noise measurement"
        instructions: >
          Sentinel runs noise.py on each dimension across all evaluators.
          Reports: CV per dimension, overall CV, and the dimension with
          maximum disagreement.
        script_call: >
          python3 ${SENTINEL_ROOT}/skills/decision-hygiene/scripts/noise.py
          --json '{"algorithm": "cv", "data": [member1_score, member2_score, ...]}'
        interpretation:
          cv_below_15: "LOW noise - genuine agreement on this dimension"
          cv_15_to_30: "MODERATE - worth discussing what's driving the difference"
          cv_30_to_50: "HIGH - significant disagreement. Discuss before deciding."
          cv_above_50: "VERY HIGH - committee is not evaluating, it is negotiating. This dimension is not ready for a decision."

      phase_3:
        name: "Structured discussion"
        instructions: >
          ONLY discuss the highest-noise dimensions. Do NOT average scores.
          Goal: understand WHAT is driving the disagreement, not who is right.
          Two sources of noise: information difference (one evaluator has data
          others don't) vs. interpretation difference (same data, different
          weighting). These require different responses.
        facilitation_questions:
          - "What specific evidence drove your score? Not your conclusion - your evidence."
          - "Did anyone have information the others didn't? If yes - share the information, not the conclusion."
          - "After hearing the evidence: would anyone change their score? Why or why not?"

      phase_4:
        name: "Reporting"
        output: >
          Noise Audit Report per target:
          - Overall committee noise (CV)
          - Per-dimension noise with highest/lowest scores
          - Dimensions with CV > 30% flagged for further due diligence
          - Information gaps identified during discussion

    description: >
      Reference class statistics for M&A outcomes. The outside view
      that inside-view optimism systematically ignores.
      Use these to calibrate projections and stress-test the deal thesis.
    statistics:
      deal_success:
        - stat: "70% of M&A deals fail to create value for the acquirer (McKinsey, multiple studies)"
          source: "McKinsey Global Institute, various"
          implication: "Your prior on this deal should be 30% success, not 70%. Adjust."

        - stat: "Acquirer stock price falls an average of 1-3% on deal announcement"
          source: "Andrade et al., Journal of Finance, 2001"
          implication: "Markets immediately discount most acquisitions. Why is your deal different?"

        - stat: "Only 23% of acquisitions recover their cost of capital within 10 years (KPMG)"
          source: "KPMG Unlocking Shareholder Value, 1999"
          implication: "The downside scenario is not the exception - it is the median outcome."

      synergies:
        - stat: "Revenue synergies are achieved at 30-40% of projected levels in median deal"
          source: "Deloitte M&A Trends Report, 2022"
          implication: "Discount all revenue synergies by 60-70% for base case modeling."

        - stat: "Cost synergies are achieved at 60-70% of projected levels in median deal"
          source: "McKinsey, The Art of Synergies"
          implication: "Even cost synergies - the 'easy' kind - underperform by 30-40%."

        - stat: "Integration costs average 25% higher than projected"
          source: "BCG M&A Integration Study, 2020"
          implication: "Add 25% to your integration cost estimate before presenting to the board."

      integration:
        - stat: "Integration takes 40-60% longer than initially projected in most deals"
          source: "Bain & Company, Mastering the Art of M&A"
          implication: "Your 18-month integration plan should be modeled as a 27-month plan."

        - stat: "Key talent attrition in acquired companies averages 25-30% in year 1"
          source: "Willis Towers Watson, M&A integration survey"
          implication: "Model the cost of losing 1 in 4 key employees in the acquired company."

          source: "Mergerstat Review, historical data"
          implication: "You are starting 30-40% in the hole. Your synergies must be real enough to overcome this."

  - id: INTEGRATION_PREMORTEM_FRAMEWORK
    name: "Integration Pre-mortem - 7 Failure Modes"
    description: >
      Pre-mortem focused specifically on post-acquisition integration.
      The deal failing is less common than the integration failing.
      These are the 7 most documented integration failure modes,
      not the deal failure modes.
    premise: >
      "It's 24 months after close. The acquisition is considered a failure.
      Not the deal terms - the integration. What happened?"
    failure_modes:
      - id: INT1
        name: "Key talent exodus"
        description: >
          The target's best people left in months 3-9. They joined competitors.
          The acquirer's culture, compensation structure, or bureaucracy drove them out.
          The IP, relationships, and institutional knowledge left with them.
        early_warning: "Multiple LinkedIn updates from target employees in months 1-3"
        prevention: "Named retention plan for top 20 people in the target, before close"

      - id: INT2
        name: "IT integration paralysis"
        description: >
          The two IT systems were incompatible at a deeper level than the
          integration plan anticipated. The estimated 6-month integration
          became 30 months. During that period, the business ran on two systems,
          creating data inconsistencies, customer service failures, and
          integration team burnout.
        early_warning: "Integration timeline slips by > 20% in first 90 days"
        prevention: "Independent IT architecture review before close, by someone with no skin in the deal"

      - id: INT3
        name: "Culture conflict at scale"
        description: >
          Cultural friction was identified in due diligence but labeled
          as "manageable." It proved unmanageable at scale. The target's
          autonomy culture collided with the acquirer's process culture.
          Middle management in the target became passive-aggressive resistors.
          The integration plan assumed cooperation that never materialized.
        early_warning: "Middle manager turnover in target exceeds 15% in first year"
        prevention: "Skip-level conversations with 10+ non-C-suite employees in target before LOI"

      - id: INT4
        name: "Customer attrition"
        description: >
          The target's customers were loyal to the company's independence,
          team, or brand positioning. Post-acquisition, they churned at
          rates 2-3x historical. Some explicitly cited the acquisition as
          the reason. The acquirer's brand either commoditized the offering
          or created competitive concerns.
        early_warning: "Target's NPS drops > 10 points in first 6 months"
        prevention: "Direct interviews with target's top 10 customers before close"

      - id: INT5
        name: "Synergy execution collapse"
        description: >
          The synergy owners were named in the integration plan but had
          no authority, budget, or organizational support to execute.
          Synergies required cooperation between departments that had
          conflicting incentives. The $50M synergy plan delivered $8M.
        early_warning: "Synergy tracker shows < 30% on plan at 12 months"
        prevention: "For each synergy line: name the owner, their budget authority, and the cross-functional dependencies"

      - id: INT6
        name: "Management distraction"
        description: >
          The integration consumed 40-60% of senior management attention
          for 18+ months. Core business metrics deteriorated because the
          leadership team was in integration meetings. The acquirer's
          business underperformed while chasing the acquisition thesis.
        early_warning: "Acquirer's organic growth rate falls > 15% relative to pre-deal trend"
        prevention: "Dedicated integration PMO with CEO-level sponsor. Integration management is not a side project."

      - id: INT7
        name: "Regulatory and contractual landmines"
        description: >
          Post-close review revealed contracts, customer agreements, or
          regulatory obligations that weren't fully surfaced during due
          diligence. Change-of-control provisions triggered. Government
          contracts required re-bidding. Key partnerships were at-will
          and walked away post-announcement.
        early_warning: "Legal review flags unresolved items > 30 days after close"
        prevention: "Dedicated legal due diligence pass specifically on change-of-control provisions, government contracts, and partnership agreements"
