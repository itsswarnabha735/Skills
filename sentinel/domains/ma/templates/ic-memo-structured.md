# IC Memo - Sentinel Structured Format

## Purpose

Investment Committee memo with MAP scoring embedded at each section.
This memo IS the deliverable - Sentinel doesn't replace the memo,
it structures how the evidence is presented.

The structured format prevents the most common IC memo failure:
a compelling narrative that buries the weak dimensions in prose.
