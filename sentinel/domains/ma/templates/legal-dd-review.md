# Legal Due Diligence Review - Sentinel M&A

## Purpose

Structured legal DD review that forces probability weighting, disclosure
materiality assessment, and negotiation triage.
Designed for M&A counsel who need to present a legally complete AND
commercially actionable assessment.

The goal is not to list every risk. It is to tell the client:
**which risks are real, how probable they are, and what to do about them.**

## Part 1 - Legal DD MAP Scoring

*Score each dimension 0-10. Assign confidence separately.
Score BEFORE writing the detailed risk list.*

| Dimension | Score /10 | Confidence % | Flag |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| D1 - Title and ownership clarity | | | |
| D2 - Contractual risk / change-of-control | | | |
| D3 - Regulatory and compliance posture | | | |
| D4 - Litigation exposure | | | |
| D5 - Employment and social risk | | | |
| **Legal quality total** | **/50** | | |

**Interpretation**:
- 40-50 -> Clean legal posture, standard provisions
- 30-39 -> Addressable issues, specific protections required
- 20-29 -> Material concerns - price, structure, or conditions required
- < 20 -> Fundamental legal exposure - deal should not proceed as structured

**Lowest confidence dimension**: ___
*This is where your legal assessment is most exposed. Flag explicitly to client.*

## Part 2 - Legal Risk Prioritization Matrix

*For each identified risk: assign probability AND impact BEFORE writing the narrative.*
*This is the hardest column to fill. Fill it anyway.*

| # | Risk description | Probability | Impact | Priority | Treatment |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| 1 | | Remote/Possible/Probable/Likely | Negligible/Moderate/Significant/Severe | 1-4 | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |
| 6 | | | | | |
| 7 | | | | | |

**Probability scale**: Remote < 5% | Possible 5-25% | Probable 25-60% | Likely > 60%
**Impact scale**: Negligible < 0.5% of EV | Moderate 0.5-2% | Significant 2-5% | Severe > 5%
**Priority**: 1 (lowest) -> 4 (deal-material)

### Priority 4 risks (immediate client escalation required)

*Risks with Probable/Likely probability AND Significant/Severe impact.*

| Risk | Financial exposure estimate | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| | $__ - $__ | |
| | | |

---

## Part 3 - Disclosure Letter Assessment

*Complete AFTER reading the disclosure letter. Apply DISCLOSURE_LETTER_PROTOCOL.*

Top 5 assumptions underlying the deal valuation:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### Post-reading: materiality screen

| Disclosure | Touches valuation assumption? | Flagged by fresh reader? | Financial impact range | Action required? |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|:---:|
| | Y / N | Y / N | $__ - $__ | Y / N |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

---

## Part 4 - Change-of-Control Exposure

*The most commonly underestimated legal risk in M&A.*

### Key contracts reviewed for change-of-control provisions

| Contract | Counterparty | Revenue/value | CoC provision? | Waiver required? | Risk level |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| | | $__ | Y / N | Y / N | H/M/L |
| | | | | | |

**Total revenue under CoC-exposed contracts**: $___
**% of target revenue**: ___%

**Waiver strategy**:
- [ ] All material waivers secured pre-close
- [ ] Waivers in progress: ___ / ___ obtained
- [ ] No waivers sought - risk accepted
- [ ] Specific contracts flagged as conditions precedent to close

## Part 5 - Negotiation Triage

*Apply NEGOTIATION_PRIORITY_FILTER to all currently contested SPA/SHA points.*
*For each open point: is the fight worth the cost?*

| Open point | Max exposure if lost | Probability invoked | Expected value | Legal cost to fight | Decision |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| | $__ | __% | $__ | $__ | Fight / Concede / Escalate |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Points recommended to concede** (expected value < negotiation cost):

**Points recommended to escalate to client** (expected value > 1% of deal value):

## Questioner - the questions M&A lawyers skip

*Answer in writing before issuing the DD report.*

**Q1 (LA1 - Risk probability)**:
Of all the risks identified in this report, which 3 are most likely to
actually materialize? Have you told the client that explicitly,
separate from the full list?

**Q2 (LA5 - Disclosure normalization)**:
Is there any disclosure in the disclosure letter that, if you
learned about it on day 1 of the deal, would have changed your
advice to the client? If yes - why hasn't it changed anything now?

**Q3 (LA4 - Adversarial escalation)**:
Is there any point currently being negotiated where you are fighting
on principle rather than for a commercially material outcome for the client?
What is the expected value of that point vs. the cost of fighting for it?

**Q4 (LA3 - Professional liability)**:
Is any part of your DD report qualified primarily to protect the firm
rather than to inform the client? What would the unqualified version say?
