# Integration Pre-mortem - Sentinel M&A

## Purpose

A pre-mortem on integration, not on the deal.

Most M&A pre-mortems ask "what if the deal fails?" The deal rarely fails
outright. The integration fails. This template focuses exclusively on the
24 months after close - the period that determines whether value is created
or destroyed.

Run this BEFORE LOI signature. Running it after LOI is still valuable.
Running it after close is too late.

## Deal

- **Target**:
- **Expected close date**:
- **Facilitator**:
- **Participants** (include integration leads, NOT deal team leads - different perspective):
- **Date**:
---


## Setup (read to the room)

> "It's 24 months after the close of this acquisition. The acquisition is
> considered a failure - not because of the deal terms, but because of
> the integration. The projected synergies were not achieved. Key people left.
> Customers churned. Management attention was consumed for 18 months.
> The acquirer's stock is down from the day of announcement.
>
> Your job for the next 20 minutes is to describe what happened.
> Assume the failure is real. You are a journalist writing the post-mortem.
> Write your diagnosis alone, in writing, before we discuss.
>
> Do NOT defend the plan. Do NOT say this is unlikely. Assume it happened."

## Group analysis - 7 integration failure modes

*For each, discuss evidence that this specific failure could occur in THIS deal.*

### INT1 - Key talent exodus

> *The target's best people left in months 3-9. The IP, relationships,
> and institutional knowledge left with them.*

**Evidence this could happen in this deal**:
- What % of target value is embedded in people vs. systems/contracts?
- Who are the top 10 people in the target, and what keeps them there today?
- Do any have at-will contracts or are they already post-vesting?

**Named retention plan for top 10 exists?** [ ] Yes  [ ] No  [ ] Partial

**Probability**: ___% **Severity**: ___/10

**Prevention action** (specific, with owner and deadline):

---

### INT2 - IT integration paralysis

> *The two IT systems were incompatible at a deeper level than anticipated.
> The 6-month integration became 30 months.*

**Evidence this could happen in this deal**:
- Has an independent IT architecture review been completed?
- What are the target's core systems (ERP, CRM, data infrastructure)?
- What's the current best estimate for IT integration? Who built that estimate?

**Independent IT review completed?** [ ] Yes  [ ] No

**Probability**: ___% **Severity**: ___/10

**Prevention action**:

---

### INT3 - Culture conflict at scale

> *Cultural friction labeled as "manageable" proved unmanageable at scale.
> Middle management became passive-aggressive resistors.*

**Evidence this could happen in this deal**:
- Have you spoken to 5+ non-C-suite employees in the target? What did you find?
- How does the target make decisions? (consensus / hierarchical / autonomous)
- What's the target's attitude toward the acquirer's culture? (admiring / neutral / suspicious)

**Skip-level conversations completed?** [ ] Yes (___ conversations)  [ ] No

**Probability**: ___% **Severity**: ___/10

**Prevention action**:

---

### INT4 - Customer attrition

> *Target's customers were loyal to its independence. Post-acquisition,
> they churned at 2-3x historical rates.*

**Evidence this could happen in this deal**:
- Have you interviewed the target's top 10 customers about their reaction to the acquisition?
- Are any customers contractually allowed to exit on change of control?
- Are any customers also customers of the acquirer, creating relationship conflicts?

**Customer interviews completed?** [ ] Yes (___ conversations)  [ ] No

**Probability**: ___% **Severity**: ___/10

**Prevention action**:

---

### INT5 - Synergy execution collapse

> *Synergy owners had no authority, budget, or organizational support.
> The $50M plan delivered $8M.*

**Evidence this could happen in this deal**:
- For each synergy line: is there a named owner with actual budget authority?
- Which synergies require cross-functional cooperation between departments
  with conflicting incentives?
- Who has signed off on their ability to execute each synergy?

**Synergy owners named with budget authority?** [ ] All  [ ] Some  [ ] None

**Probability**: ___% **Severity**: ___/10

**Prevention action**:

---

### INT6 - Management distraction

> *Integration consumed 40-60% of senior management attention for 18+ months.
> Core business metrics deteriorated.*

**Evidence this could happen in this deal**:
- Who is the integration PMO lead? What % of their time is dedicated to integration?
- What does the integration governance structure look like post-close?
- What are the critical business initiatives the acquirer will run in parallel?
  Which ones will lose attention?

**Dedicated integration PMO with named lead?** [ ] Yes  [ ] No

**Probability**: ___% **Severity**: ___/10

**Prevention action**:

---

### INT7 - Contractual and regulatory landmines

> *Post-close review revealed change-of-control provisions, government
> contract requirements, or partnership agreements that weren't fully surfaced.*

**Evidence this could happen in this deal**:
- Has legal DD specifically reviewed all change-of-control provisions in customer contracts?
- Are there any government contracts? What are the re-bid requirements?
- What key partnerships or licensing agreements are at-will or change-of-control triggered?

**Change-of-control review complete?** [ ] Yes  [ ] In progress  [ ] Not yet

**Probability**: ___% **Severity**: ___/10

**Prevention action**:

---
