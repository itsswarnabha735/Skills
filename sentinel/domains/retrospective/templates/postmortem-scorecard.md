What information was available at decision time?
- Data we had: ___________________________
- Key unknowns we acknowledged: ___________________________
- Key unknowns we did NOT acknowledge: ___________________________

What was our confidence in the outcome at decision time? (0-100%) _____%

What were the 3 main arguments FOR the decision we made?
1. ___________________________
2. ___________________________
3. ___________________________

What were the 3 main arguments AGAINST, and how did we address them?
1. Against: _______________ / Response: _______________
2. Against: _______________ / Response: _______________
3. Against: _______________ / Response: _______________

## PART 2 — Evaluate OUTCOME quality (separate from decision)

What actually happened? ___________________________

Outcome rating (1-5):
- 1: Much worse than expected
- 3: Roughly as expected
- 5: Much better than expected

Rating: _____ / Notes: ___________________________

What external factors contributed to the outcome (independent of our decisions)?
Favorable external factors: ___________________________
Unfavorable external factors: ___________________________

---

## PART 3 — Evaluate DECISION quality (separate from outcome)

Given ONLY the information available at decision time:

**Was the decision process sound?**

| Dimension | Rating (1-5) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Information gathered | | |
| Analysis quality | | |
| Bias checks performed | | |
| Dissent surfaced | | |
| Kill criteria defined | | |

**Decision quality score**: _____ / 5

**The 2x2 classification:**
```
                    GOOD OUTCOME    BAD OUTCOME
GOOD DECISION   →   [ ] Deserved    [ ] Bad luck
BAD DECISION    →   [ ] Dumb luck   [ ] Deserved
```

Which cell? ☐ Deserved win ☐ Bad luck ☐ Dumb luck ☐ Deserved loss

## PART 4 — Attribution audit (anti-Self-Serving Bias)

**For outcomes above expectations — what external factors helped?**
(Resist attributing all success to skill)
___________________________

**For outcomes below expectations — what internal decisions contributed?**
(Resist attributing all failure to external factors)
___________________________

**Most honest sentence about causality:**
"This outcome was driven primarily by [internal/external] factors, specifically: _______________"

---

## PART 5 — Bias audit on this retrospective

Check yourself:

☐ **Hindsight Bias**: Am I saying things were "obvious" that were not obvious at decision time?
☐ **Choice-Supportive Bias**: Am I remembering the decision as better than it was?
☐ **Self-Serving Bias**: Am I attributing success to us and failure to external factors?
☐ **Outcome Bias**: Am I evaluating the DECISION based on the OUTCOME rather than the process?

Corrections applied: ___________________________

## PART 6 — Transferable learning statement

The learning statement must be:
- **Specific** (not "be more careful")
- **Transferable** (applicable next time)
- **Falsifiable** (we'll know it worked when...)
- **Mechanistic** (names the cognitive failure, not just the outcome)

**Learning statement:**
"In future decisions of type [___], we will [specific action] because this retrospective showed that [cognitive mechanism — e.g., Planning Fallacy, Survivorship Bias] led to [specific error]. We will know this learning was applied when [observable indicator]."
