         CRITICAL INHIBITION (ABSOLUTE)
        
        Heuristic: LOSS_AVERSION (Amygdala-driven)
        Appropriateness: {score}% (INAPPROPRIATE)
        
         EXTREME RISK: Decision dominated by loss aversion.
        
         CANNOT PROCEED in emotional state.
        
        REQUIRED:
        1. Take 10-minute cool-down break
        2. Calculate expected value objectively
        3. Reframe in gain domain
        4. Then decide
        
        Why: Houde (2019) - Loss aversion hardest to inhibit.
        Amygdala + Insula override DLPFC. Need emotional cool-down.
      
      STRONG: |

        Appropriateness: {score}%
        
        Questions:
        - Weighting losses >2x gains?
        - Objectively high risk, or just "feels" bad?
        
        BLOCKED: Complete reframing first.

  SUNK_COST:
    houde_difficulty: 3
    
    alternatives:
      - method: INCREMENTAL_ANALYSIS
        description: Only consider future costs/benefits
        instructions:
          - Ignore all past costs (sunk)
          - List only future costs
          - List only future benefits
          - Decision = future benefits > future costs?
        difficulty: 2
        effectiveness: 0.90
        
      - method: ZERO_BASED_DECISION
        description: Pretend sunk costs don't exist
        instructions:
          - Imagine you haven't invested anything
          - Would you START this now?
          - If no -> stop
          - If yes -> continue
        difficulty: 3
        effectiveness: 0.85
        
      - method: OPPORTUNITY_COST_FRAMING
        description: What else could we do?
        instructions:
          - List alternative uses of resources
          - Compare EV of continuing vs alternatives

         SUNK COST FALLACY DETECTED
        
        You cited past investments as justification.
        
         This is ALWAYS incorrect reasoning.
        
        Past costs are SUNK (unrecoverable).
        Only future matters.
        
        BLOCKED: Use incremental analysis.
        
        Exercise:
        1. Cross out all past cost mentions
        2. Only consider: future costs vs future benefits
        3. Decide based on that alone

      instructions:
        - Don't rely on single vivid case

      Vivid/recent example dominating judgment.
      
      Your mind weighs this case too heavily because:
      - It's recent
      - It's vivid/emotional
      - Easy to recall
      
      BLOCKED: Look up base rates first.
