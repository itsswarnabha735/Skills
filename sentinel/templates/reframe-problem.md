# Problem Reframing Template

**Objective**: Solves the "Right Answer check for the Wrong Problem" error.

## 1. The Presented Problem

"How do we [X]?"

## 2. The Abstraction Ladder (Vertical Reframing)

_Move up to "Why?" and down to "How?"._

- **Why** do we want X? -> [Higher level goal] -> [Even higher goal]
- **How** else can we achieve [Higher level goal]? -> [Alternative Problem 1]

## 3. The Lateral Shift (Horizontal Reframing)

_Change the domain or metaphor._

- If this were a [Biological] problem, how would we solve it?
- If this were a [Military] problem, how would we solve it?
- If this were a [Game], how would we win?

## 4. The Parameter Challenge

_List constraints assumed to be true._

- Constraint: [Budget is fixed] -> **Reframe**: What if budget was zero? What if it was infinite?
- Constraint: [Deadline is tight] -> **Reframe**: What if we had 10 years?

## 5. The Component Breakdown

_Break the problem into sub-problems._

- Part A: [Sub-problem 1]
- Part B: [Sub-problem 2]
- Focus: Which part is the _real_ bottleneck?

## 6. The Restated Problem

"How might we [New Definition]?"
