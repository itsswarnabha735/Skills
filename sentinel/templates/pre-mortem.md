# Pre-Mortem Analysis

**Decision**: [What was decided]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Timeframe**: Imagining failure at [date + 12 months]

## The scenario

It is [future date]. The decision to [description] has **failed completely**.

## Failure modes

| # | What went wrong | Likelihood | Preventable? | Early warning signal |
|---|----------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | [Mode 1]       | HIGH       | Yes/No      | [Red flag to watch]  |
| 2 | [Mode 2]       | MEDIUM     | Yes/No      | [Red flag to watch]  |
| 3 | [Mode 3]       | MEDIUM     | Yes/No      | [Red flag to watch]  |
| 4 | [Mode 4]       | LOW        | Yes/No      | [Red flag to watch]  |
| 5 | [Mode 5]       | LOW        | Yes/No      | [Red flag to watch]  |

## Top 3 risks and mitigations

### Risk 1: [Most likely failure mode]
- **Why it happens**: [Root cause]
- **Prevention**: [Specific action to take NOW]
- **Red flag**: [Observable signal that this is happening]

### Risk 2: [Second most likely]
- **Why it happens**: [Root cause]
- **Prevention**: [Specific action to take NOW]
- **Red flag**: [Observable signal]

### Risk 3: [Third most likely]
- **Why it happens**: [Root cause]
- **Prevention**: [Specific action to take NOW]
- **Red flag**: [Observable signal]

## Action items

- [ ] [Prevention action 1] - Owner: [Name] - By: [Date]
- [ ] [Prevention action 2] - Owner: [Name] - By: [Date]
- [ ] [Set up monitoring for red flag 1]
- [ ] [Schedule review at midpoint]

## Technique
Based on Gary Klein's pre-mortem (1998): prospective hindsight exploits
hindsight bias constructively - people are better at explaining failures
than predicting them.
