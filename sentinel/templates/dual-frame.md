# Dual Frame Template (Comprehensive Verification Framework)

**Objective**: Neutralize Loss Aversion and Framing Effects by explicitly presenting the same choice in two opposing frames.

## Frame A: The Gain Frame (Standard)

_Focus on what success looks like._

**Proposal**:
[Describe the option here]

**Upside**:

- [Gain 1]
- [Gain 2]
- Probability of Success: [X]%

---

## Frame B: The Loss Frame (Inverted)

_Focus on what failure costs._

**Inversion**:
[Describe the option as avoiding a loss]

**Downside**:

- If we don't do this, we lose [Opportunity Cost]
- If we do this and fail, we lose [Direct Cost]
- Probability of Failure: [100 - X]%
---


## Decision Integrity Check

1. Does the proposal look attractive in Frame A but terrifying in Frame B?
2. Are you accepting a risk in Frame B just to avoid a sure loss (Loss Aversion)?
3. Are you rejecting a risk in Frame A just to protect a small gain?

**Verdict**:
[ ] Proceed
[ ] Abandon
[ ] Gather more data
