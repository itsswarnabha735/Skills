## Critique Framework

Run through all 5 lenses:

### Lens 1 — The 5-Second Test

Imagine a stranger lands on this page. In 5 seconds, they should know:
1. What is this?
2. Who is it for?
3. What do I do next?

**Pass / Fail + why.**

### Lens 2 — Copy Critique

Evaluate headline:
- Does it state an outcome or just describe the product?
- Would a 10-year-old understand it?
- Is it specific or generic?

Evaluate sub-headline:
- Does it clarify who it's for?
- Does it remove the top objection?

Evaluate CTAs:
- Is the action specific?
- Does it state what happens after clicking?

Evaluate body copy:
- Feature-focused or benefit-focused?
- Any "we" language that could be "you" language?
- Corporate speak to remove?

### Lens 3 — Design Critique

Apply frontend-design skill anti-patterns check:
- [ ] Glassmorphism overuse
- [ ] Gradient text on headlines
- [ ] Identical card grids
- [ ] Cyan-on-dark AI aesthetic
- [ ] Inter/Roboto/generic system fonts
- [ ] Pure black or pure white (no tint)
- [ ] Gray text on colored backgrounds
- [ ] Cards inside cards

Rate overall design: **Forgettable / Adequate / Distinctive / Exceptional**

### Lens 4 — Conversion Audit

Check each section:
- Hero: CTA visible without scrolling on mobile?
- Proof: Specific names + results or generic?
- Friction: How many steps to convert?
- Trust: Why should I believe this?
- Objections: Are the top 3 addressed?

Score each section: 🔴 Critical fix / 🟡 Improve / 🟢 Good

### Lens 5 — Mobile Check

- Is the hero readable at 375px?
- Are CTAs thumb-reachable?
- Is text at least 16px?
- Do images resize correctly?
