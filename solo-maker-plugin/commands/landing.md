## What Are We Building For?

<description> #$ARGUMENTS </description>

If empty, ask: "Which project are we building this landing page for? (This should match a project folder in `data/1-Projets/`)"

We need the **Landing Page Copy** generated by the `solo` master plugin.
Check for `data/1-Projets/[project-name]/landing-page-copy-*.md`.

If it does not exist, STOP and tell the user: "I need the landing page copy first. Please run `/solo:build launch` in the core plugin to generate the copy, then come back here to build the page."

## Build Process

### 1. Ingest the Copy

Read the `landing-page-copy-*.md` file. Do not invent new sections or rewrite the strategy.
Extract:

- Headline and sub-headline
- Primary CTA
- Problem, Solution, and Features
- Social proof and Testimonials
- Pricing and FAQ

### 2. Choose Design Direction

Pick ONE bold aesthetic from frontend-design skill. Announce it:
"Design direction: [name] — [one sentence description of the visual concept]"

Then commit. No hedging. No generic.

### 3. Build the HTML

Structure:

```
<nav> — minimal (logo + 1 CTA only)
<section#hero> — headline, sub, CTA, hero visual
<section#proof-bar> — logos or quick stat
<section#problem> — pain points
<section#solution> — product intro + 3 benefits
<section#how-it-works> — 3 steps
<section#testimonials> — 3 quotes with photos
<section#pricing> — (if applicable)
<section#faq> — 5 objection-busters
<section#cta> — final conversion push
<footer> — minimal
```

### 4. Quality Check

- [ ] 5-second test: stranger knows what this is immediately
- [ ] CTA visible without scrolling (mobile + desktop)
- [ ] No Lorem ipsum anywhere
- [ ] Mobile layout functional at 375px
- [ ] Design has committed aesthetic (not generic)
- [ ] At least 3 social proof elements

### 5. Deliver

Output: `[product-name]-landing.html` — fully self-contained, deployable.

Close with:
"Landing page built. Drop this file into any host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) and it's live. Key conversion bets I made: [2-3 strategic choices explained]."
