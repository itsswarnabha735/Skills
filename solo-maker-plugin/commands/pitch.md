# Build a Pitch Deck

**Load these skills before starting:**

1. `solopreneur` skill
2. `pitch-deck` skill
3. `frontend-design` skill

## Context

<description> #$ARGUMENTS </description>

If empty, ask: "Which project are we building this pitch for? (This should match a project folder in `data/1-Projets/`)"

We need the context generated by the `solo` master plugin.
Read `data/1-Projets/[project-name]/PRD.md` and `DESIGN-BRIEF.md`.

If they do not exist, ask the user to provide the pitch details or run `/solo:build design` in the core plugin first.

## Build Process

### 1. Define the Narrative Arc

Based on deck type, map the story:

**Investor:**
Hook → Problem → Solution → How it works → Market → Traction → Business model → Competition → GTM → Ask → Team → Vision

**Client:**
Their name/problem → We understand you → Our solution → How it works → Proof → Process → Investment → Next steps

### 2. Write Slide Content

For each slide:

- **Headline**: The single point this slide makes (not a label, a statement)
- **Body**: Minimal — max 3 bullets OR 1 key stat OR 1 image concept
- **Speaker note**: The story the presenter tells aloud

Use real numbers where possible. If unknown, write realistic placeholders marked `[PLACEHOLDER]`.

### 3. Design the Deck

Choose aesthetic from frontend-design skill. Pitch decks work best with:

- High contrast (dark backgrounds for visual impact, light for text-heavy)
- Large, confident typography
- One hero visual per slide
- Consistent color accent used sparingly
- No clip art, no stock businessman photos

### 4. Build the HTML Presentation

Build as a full-screen slide deck:

```html
<!-- Slide navigation: arrow keys + click -->
<!-- Progress indicator: slide X of Y -->
<!-- Print mode: all slides visible when printed -->
<!-- Each slide: full viewport, centered content -->
```

### 5. Deliver

Output: `[company-name]-pitch.html`

Include a `<!-- PRESENTER NOTES -->` HTML comment block at the end with the speaker narrative for each slide.

Close with:
"Deck built. [X] slides. Open in any browser for full-screen presentation (F11). Print to PDF for sharing. Key narrative choices: [explain 2-3 strategic decisions about the story arc]."
