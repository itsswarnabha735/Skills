# The Persuasive Storyboard Workbook: The V.I.P. Framework

A professional product demo is not a feature tour; it is a **persuasive narrative**. This workbook uses the **V.I.P. Framework (Vision, Insight, Proof)** to ensure your video converts viewers into users.

---

## Phase 1: The Vision (The Hook - 0:00 to 0:05)

_Grab attention by reflecting the user's aspirational identity._

- **The Hook**: "Imagine a world where [Pain] simply doesn't exist."
- **The Identity**: "You didn't start your business to spend your life in [Category of Pain]."
- **Visual**: High-contrast text overlay or a hero shot of the `persona` in a "Success State."

## Phase 2: The Insight (The Gap - 0:05 to 0:20)

_Agitate the problem and show why current solutions fail._

- **The Gap**: "Most tools focus on [Feature], but the real problem is [Insight from discovery-process]."
- **The Evidence**: "We analyzed [Data Source] and found that [Metric] is the real killer of solo productivity."
- **Visual**: Split-screen showing the "Chaotic Old Way" vs. the "Strategic New Way."

## Phase 3: The Reveal (The 'Aha!' - 0:20 to 0:30)

_Introduce the product as the hero that bridges the gap._

- **The Big Reveal**: "Introducing [Product Name]: The first [Category Name] built for [Persona]."
- **Visual**: Logo animation and the primary dashboard reveal.

## Phase 4: The Proof (The Core Loop - 0:30 to 1:00)

_Demonstrate the 3 features that deliver on the Vision._

1.  **Proof Point 1 (Speed)**: Show the `/solo:invoice` command. "From task to payment in 60 seconds."
2.  **Proof Point 2 (Intelligence)**: Show the `opportunity-solution-tree`. "Map your strategy, not just your tasks."
3.  **Proof Point 3 (Automation)**: Show the `voiceover-generator`. "Product demos that ship while you sleep."

## Phase 5: The Impact (The Result - 1:00 to 1:15)

_Quantify the value in terms of the business outcome._

- **The Result**: "Join the [Number] of solopreneurs who have reclaimed [Hours] every week."
- **Visual**: Customer quote from `discovery-log.md` with a high-trust headshot.

## Phase 6: The Directive (Call to Action - 1:15 to 1:30)

_Tell them exactly what to do next._

- **The Directive**: "Build your first [Project] today at [URL]."
- **Visual**: Final UI shot with a clear "Sign Up" button.

## Storyboarding Best Practices

- **Text-to-Visual Ratio**: Never show a feature without explaining the benefit simultaneously in the audio.
- **Pacing**: Cut every 3-5 seconds to maintain high energy.
- **Consistency**: Use the colors and fonts defined in your `brand-assets.json`.
