## Choosing the Right Variant

| Variant             | Best For                                  | Key Metric                                | Distribution Channels                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Product Demo**    | Marketing, lead gen, social media         | Conversion rate (trial signups)           | YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, landing pages |
| **Investor Pitch**  | Fundraising, partnerships, board meetings | Investment secured, partnerships signed   | Pitch decks, investor emails, demo days   |
| **User Onboarding** | Activation, retention, support            | Activation rate, support ticket reduction | In-app, email sequences, help center      |

## Customization Tips

1. **Adjust Duration**: Scale timing proportionally if you need a different length (e.g., 45s Product Demo = 75% of each scene duration)
2. **Adapt Tone**: Match voice-dna.json personality (e.g., "playful" tone = more casual language, emojis in text overlays)
3. **Localize**: Translate scripts while preserving structure and timing
4. **A/B Test**: Create 2 versions with different hooks or CTAs to optimize conversion
