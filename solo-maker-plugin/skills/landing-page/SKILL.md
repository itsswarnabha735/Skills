# Landing Page Skill

A landing page has one job: convert a specific visitor into a specific action.

## The Golden Rule

**One page. One audience. One action.**

Every element either supports the conversion or it's noise. Remove noise.

---

## Page Architecture

### Section 1 — Hero (Above the Fold)
**The most important real estate. 80% of users won't scroll if this fails.**

Required elements:
- **Headline** — the outcome promise (use copywriting skill formulas)
- **Sub-headline** — who it's for + main objection removed
- **Hero visual** — product, result, or powerful image
- **Primary CTA** — action + outcome (not "Submit")
- **Trust signal** — one line: ratings, user count, press mention

Design notes:
- No navigation that leaks visitors off-page (or minimal nav)
- Contrast the CTA button sharply — it must be unmissable
- Mobile hero must work without the visual if needed

### Section 2 — Social Proof Bar
**Logos or quick numbers. Borrow authority.**

Options:
- "As seen in" logos (press)
- "Trusted by X customers" + avatar stack
- Key metric: "4.9/5 from 200+ reviews"

Keep it compact. One row. No descriptions.

### Section 3 — Problem / Pain
**Make the visitor feel understood before you sell.**

Structure:
1. Name their situation (3-4 bullet points of pain)
2. Transition: "Sound familiar? You're not alone."
3. Bridge to solution

Tone: empathetic, not fear-mongering. You're a friend who gets it.

### Section 4 — Solution Introduction
**Introduce the product with clarity and confidence.**

- Product name + visual
- One-sentence description
- 3 core benefits (outcomes, not features)

### Section 5 — How It Works
**Remove confusion. Confidence comes from clarity.**

3-step process (no more):
1. [Simple action] → 2. [What happens] → 3. [Result they get]

Each step: icon + title + one sentence. Nothing more.

### Section 6 — Features / Details
**For the analytical buyer who needs specifics.**

Use a feature grid or tabs. But frame every feature as a benefit:
- Feature: "Automated email sequences"
- Benefit: "Your leads get followed up automatically — even while you sleep"

### Section 7 — Social Proof / Testimonials
**The most underrated conversion element.**

Rules:
- Use photos (boosts trust 34%)
- Include full name + title/context
- Quote must mention a **specific result** or **before/after**
- 3 is minimum; 5-7 is ideal
- Match testimonials to buyer objections

### Section 8 — Pricing
**Be clear. Hiding price creates friction and mistrust.**

- Show tiers clearly (3 is the sweet spot)
- Highlight the "most popular" tier
- Anchor with the higher tier
- Show what's included and excluded
- Address "but what if I…" objections inline

For services: "Starting at $X" with discovery call CTA.

### Section 9 — FAQ
**Kill the remaining objections.**

Write FAQs based on real sales conversations. Answer honestly:
- "Is this right for me if I'm just starting out?"
- "What if I need to cancel?"
- "How is this different from [main competitor]?"
- "How long until I see results?"

5-8 questions. Use an accordion for cleanliness.

### Section 10 — Final CTA
**Close the page strong.**

- Restate the core promise
- Reinforce the main benefit
- Remove final risk (money-back, free trial, cancel anytime)
- Big, unmissable CTA button

## Conversion Optimization Principles

### The Conversion Hierarchy
Focus on: **Clarity → Relevance → Trust → Urgency**

In that order. Most pages fail at clarity. Fix that before adding urgency.

### Above-the-Fold Checklist
- [ ] Visitor knows what this is within 5 seconds
- [ ] Visitor knows if it's for them within 5 seconds
- [ ] CTA is visible without scrolling on mobile
- [ ] Page loads in under 3 seconds
- [ ] No auto-playing video or audio

### Trust Signals to Include
- Real customer photos in testimonials
- Specific numbers (not "many customers" → "847 customers")
- Named company logos (not "enterprise companies")
- Founder photo + name somewhere on the page
- Clear refund / cancellation policy
- SSL and payment badges near checkout

### Mobile-First Rules
- All CTAs must be thumb-reachable
- Text minimum 16px
- Tap targets minimum 44x44px
- Images don't squish or overflow
- Forms are single-column on mobile
- Test on real device, not just DevTools

### What Kills Conversions
- Navigation with 8 links (decision paralysis)
- Three CTAs competing ("Sign up OR book a call OR download the guide")
- Stock photos of people pointing at whiteboards
- "Revolutionary", "seamless", "next-generation" anywhere in copy
- Contact form that doesn't explain what happens after submit
- Page that loads slower than 3 seconds
- Autoplay video with no mute button
