# Technical Guide: Programmatic Video with Remotion

This guide synthesizes the 26 fundamental rules for successfully creating your demo videos with React.

## 1. Fundamental Animation Principles

All animations **must** be driven by the `useCurrentFrame()` hook.

- **Formal Prohibition**: CSS transitions (`transition: all`) or CSS animations (`@keyframes`) are forbidden as they do not display correctly during frame-by-frame rendering.
- **Prohibition of Tailwind animation classes**: Use Remotion's `interpolate()` instead.

```tsx
const frame = useCurrentFrame();
const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0, 30], [0, 1]);
```

## 2. Timing and Sequencing

- **FPS (Frames per second)**: Use `useVideoConfig().fps` to calculate your durations in seconds (e.g., `2 * fps`).
- **Compositions**: Break your video down into small, atomic compositions for better performance.
- **Sequences**: Use the `<Sequence>` component to delay the entry of elements in time.

## 3. Audio and Voiceover

- Synchronize the audio generated by `voiceover-generator`.
- Use `useAudioData()` for visualizations if necessary.
- Ensure the voiceover script allows for pauses during major visual transitions.

## 4. Data and Charts

Remotion excels at displaying dynamic data.

- Use Recharts components or animated SVGs.
- Calculate data upfront (metadata) to avoid slowdowns during rendering.

## 5. Best Practices for Product Demos

- **Highlight**: Use SVG masks to emphasize a specific area of the interface.
- **Pan & Zoom**: Animate `transform` properties (`scale`, `translateX`) to draw attention.
- **AI Cursor**: Simulate mouse movement to guide the user's eye.
