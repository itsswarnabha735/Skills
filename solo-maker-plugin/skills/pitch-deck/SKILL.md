# Pitch Deck Skill

A pitch deck is not a document. It's a **story that makes the listener lean forward**.

## The Two Types of Decks

### Investor Pitch (10-12 slides)
Goal: Get a meeting or next conversation. Not to close.

### Sales / Client Pitch (8-15 slides)
Goal: Get a "yes" or "let's move forward." Show you understand their problem better than they do.

## Investor Pitch Structure

Follow this arc. Every slide earns the next.

### Slide 1 — The Hook
**One sentence. Make them curious.**

Formula: `We're building [X] for [Y] who are frustrated by [Z]`

Design: Big, confident typography. No bullet points. One striking visual.

### Slide 2 — The Problem
**Make investors feel the pain, not just understand it.**

- State the problem as a human moment, not an abstraction
- One key statistic to prove scale
- Show you've lived this problem (founder-market fit)

### Slide 3 — The Solution
**Your product solving the exact problem from slide 2.**

- One clear product statement
- Product screenshot or demo gif
- The key insight that makes this work (your "secret")

### Slide 4 — How It Works
**Simple 3-step explanation of the product.**

Keep it mechanical: Step 1 → Step 2 → Result. No jargon.

### Slide 5 — Market Size
**Show a big, believable market.**

- TAM / SAM / SOM (total, serviceable, obtainable)
- Bottom-up math preferred (shows you understand your customer)
- Reference real data sources

### Slide 6 — Traction
**Your most impressive proof of momentum.**

- Revenue / MRR / ARR with growth rate
- Users, DAU, retention metrics
- Key customer wins
- "We did X in Y days" is gold

If early: customer letters, waitlist numbers, pilot results

### Slide 7 — Business Model
**How you make money, simply.**

- Revenue stream(s)
- Pricing (ballpark)
- Unit economics if you have them
- LTV/CAC ratio if positive

### Slide 8 — Competition
**Show you understand the landscape.**

Avoid 2x2 matrix clichés. Instead:
- Name 3-5 real competitors honestly
- One sentence on why customers choose YOU
- Your defensible differentiation (not just "we're better")

### Slide 9 — Go-To-Market
**How you'll acquire customers.**

- Primary channel (be specific: cold email, SEO, content, partnerships)
- Current CAC and target
- Viral/network mechanism (if applicable)

### Slide 10 — The Ask + Use of Funds
**Be specific and confident.**

- Raise amount
- 3-4 specific uses (not vague categories)
- What milestone this gets you to (the "Series A story")

### Slide 11 — Team
**Why you are the right people.**

- Founder photos (friendly, approachable)
- One-line credential per person
- Domain expertise, relevant wins
- Advisory board if notable

### Slide 12 — Vision (Optional)
**The world you're trying to create.**

Save for the end. One bold image or statement. Emotional close.

## Client / Sales Deck Structure

### Slide 1 — Their Name + Their Problem
Don't start with your company. Start with them.

### Slides 2-3 — Show You Understand Them
Demonstrate research: industry, company, specific challenges.

### Slides 4-5 — Your Solution for Their Context
How your offer maps to their specific situation.

### Slide 6 — Proof
Case studies or results most similar to their situation.

### Slide 7 — How We Work Together
The process, timeline, what they can expect.

### Slide 8 — Investment + Next Steps
Pricing, packages, and a clear CTA.

## Slide Design Principles

- **1 idea per slide** — if you have two points, make two slides
- **60-point minimum** for any text meant to be read
- **Hero image + headline** beats bullet list every time
- **Consistent template** — same font, colors, layout across all slides
- **Dark background** works well for demos; light backgrounds for text-heavy slides
- **Data viz** — choose bar/line charts over tables; label the key insight directly on the chart

## Numbers That Matter

Always show:
- Growth rate (% is more powerful than absolute)
- Cohort retention (if strong)
- Net Revenue Retention > 100% (if applicable)
- Time to value (how fast does customer see benefit)

## Common Deck Mistakes

- 40 slides for a 10-minute pitch
- Market size slide with no math
- Competitive slide that says "no one else does what we do"
- Team slide with job titles but no accomplishments
- Financials without assumptions
- Asking for "strategic advice" instead of money
