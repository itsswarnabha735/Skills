# Copywriting Skill

Copy is the #1 lever for solopreneur conversions. Great design with weak copy fails. Strong copy with decent design wins.

## Core Principle

**Write to one person.** The buyer is a single human with a specific pain, reading your page at a specific moment. Make them feel seen.

> Bad: "We help businesses optimize their workflow."  
> Good: "Stop spending Sunday nights prepping for Monday."

## Headline Formulas

Use these proven structures. Pick the one that fits the offer:

### The Outcome Headline
`[Do desired thing] without [hated obstacle]`
- "Launch your SaaS without hiring a developer"
- "Lose 20 pounds without counting calories"

### The Before/After
`From [painful before] to [desired after] in [timeframe]`
- "From scattered notes to a published newsletter in 30 minutes"

### The Specific Claim
`[Specific number] [specific result] in [specific time]`
- "47 paying customers in 14 days — without paid ads"

### The For-You Identifier
`For [specific person] who want [specific outcome]`
- "For freelance designers who want to stop chasing invoices"

### The Question
`Are you still [doing painful thing]?`
- "Are you still pitching to clients who can't afford you?"

## The 4 Cs of Good Copy

1. **Clear** — A stranger understands it immediately
2. **Concise** — Remove every word that isn't working
3. **Compelling** — Speaks to the emotion, not just the logic
4. **Credible** — Specific details, not generic claims

## Copy Architecture for Landing Pages

```
HERO
├── Headline: The #1 outcome promise
├── Subheadline: Clarifies who it's for + removes biggest objection
├── CTA: Action-oriented, specific (not "Submit")
└── Social proof: One line of cred

PROBLEM
├── Name the pain (make them feel seen)
├── Agitate: what happens if they don't solve it
└── Transition: "There's a better way"

SOLUTION
├── Product name + one-line description
├── 3 key benefits (outcomes, not features)
└── Brief "how it works" (3 steps max)

PROOF
├── Testimonials with full names + specifics
├── Numbers / results
└── Logos (if applicable)

CTA
├── Restate the promise
├── Remove final objection
└── CTA button + micro-copy (no credit card, cancel anytime, etc.)
```

## Voice Guidelines

Ask: what voice does this product need?

| Brand Energy | Words to Use | Words to Avoid |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Friendly/casual | "you", contractions, short sentences | jargon, passive voice |
| Expert/authoritative | Specific data, process terms | "amazing", "revolutionary" |
| Playful/bold | Puns, unexpected comparisons | corporate speak |
| Premium/refined | Understated confidence, concrete detail | hype words, exclamation marks |

## CTAs That Convert

Replace generic CTAs with specific, outcome-oriented ones:

| Generic ❌ | Specific ✅ |
|-----------|-----------|
| Submit | Send my free guide |
| Sign up | Start building for free |
| Learn more | See how it works |
| Buy now | Get instant access |
| Contact us | Book a 30-min call |

## Anti-Patterns

- "We're a passionate team that believes..."
- "Our cutting-edge solution leverages..."  
- "Take your business to the next level"
- Bullet lists of features without outcomes
- Passive voice everywhere
- Headlines that describe what something IS, not what it DOES

## Email Subject Lines

For solopreneur email sequences:

- **Welcome**: "Here's what happens next" (sets expectation)
- **Value**: The specific thing you promised
- **Problem/pain**: Name their situation directly
- **Social proof**: "How [Name] did [result]"
- **CTA**: "Ready? Here's your next step"

Keep subjects under 50 characters. Avoid: "RE:", ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation.
