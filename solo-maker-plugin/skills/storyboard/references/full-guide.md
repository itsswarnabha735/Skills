# Master Guide: Narrative Engineering for Storyboards

A great storyboard is a bridge between a cold product requirement and a living, breathing emotional experience. This guide details the **Solo Method** for engineering high-impact narratives.

## 1. The 6-Frame Power Arc

Every frame has a specific psychological job to do.

1.  **Frame 1: The Status Quo (The Setup)**
    - **Goal**: Establish relatability.
    - **Trick**: Use mundane details. The sound of a ceiling fan, the cold coffee.
    - **Visual**: Medium shot, stable composition.

2.  **Frame 2: The Friction (The Itch)**
    - **Goal**: Show the first sign of trouble.
    - **Trick**: A micro-frustration. A red notification, a heavy sigh.
    - **Visual**: Close-up on the source of friction.

3.  **Frame 3: The Emotional Spike (The Crisis)**
    - **Goal**: Create visceral anxiety/pain.
    - **Trick**: High stakes. "If this doesn't work, I lose my biggest client."
    - **Visual**: Tight close-up on the character's face. Dutch angle (tilted) for tension.

4.  **Frame 4: The Pivot (The Catalyst)**
    - **Goal**: Introduce hope.
    - **Trick**: The character tries the solution. Simple, clean, fast.
    - **Visual**: Brightening the light. The "Hero Entry" of the app/tool.

5.  **Frame 5: The Aha! Moment (The Relief)**
    - **Goal**: Validate the solution.
    - **Trick**: Show the result, not the process. The "Payment Success" checkmark.
    - **Visual**: Wide shot or "Over-the-shoulder" looking at the success.

6.  **Frame 6: The New Normal (The Resolution)**
    - **Goal**: Show transformation.
    - **Trick**: Contrast with Frame 1. Peace, family time, or a smile.
    - **Visual**: Wide, open composition. Warm lighting.

## 2. The Disney Pattern (Composition)

Use these 3 levels of composition to keep the viewer engaged:

- **Establishing (The Where)**: Frame 1 & 6. Shows the environment.
- **Action (The What)**: Frame 2 & 4. Shows the interaction.
- **Emotion (The Who)**: Frame 3 & 5. Shows the psychological impact.

## 3. High-Fidelity AI Prompting

When the agent generates visuals, it must use this specialized syntax for consistent results:

**Standard Prompt Structure**:
`[Cinematic Style], [Subject Description], [Specific Action], [Environment Details], [Lighting Style], [Camera Lens/Angle], [Emotional Vibration] --v 6.0`

**Example Prompt (Frame 3)**:

> Cinematic film still, hyper-realistic, 35mm lens. A 40-year-old female founder in a dark, cluttered office. She is holding her head in her hands, looking at a broken analytics dashboard. Cold, harsh fluorescent lighting. Visible sweat, high-tension atmosphere. Moody, dramatic contrast.

## 4. The Narrative Checklist

Before finalizing, ask these 3 "Grade A" questions:

1.  **Is the Spike sharp enough?** (Is the pain real?)
2.  **Is the Aha! clear enough?** (Is the solution's impact obvious?)
3.  **Is the arc balanced?** (Does the struggle justify the reward?)
