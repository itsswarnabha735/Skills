# Connectors

## How tool references work

This plugin uses `~~category` as a placeholder for whatever tool you connect in that category (e.g., `~~design`). This allows the plugin to be tool-agnostic, describing workflows in terms of general categories rather than specific products. You can connect your preferred tools from the options below.
